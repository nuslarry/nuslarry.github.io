                        Cheng Liang Yu is now a master student of computer science in UCI and he will graduate soon in June 2020. 
                        <br>He is now actively looking for full-time software engineering job. He worked as a software engineer  
                        <br>intern at TomTom. Inc this summer. He was responsible for C++ development of GPS devices and CI/CD   
                        <br>scripted Jenkins pipeline. At the end of his internship, his work was demoed to many senior engineers 
                        <br>and got much recognition.
                        <br>
                        <br>Cheng Liang has rich experience in software development. His most recent project is a database       
                        <br>management system written in C++ which supports basic SQL operations. Besides this, last year he also 
                        <br>implemented a desktop canlendar app in Java with three other teammates. The canlendar suppports 
                        <br>agenda plannning functionalities like customized searching and recurring events. Furthermore, he also 
                        <br>has experience in real-time web application. He developed a web chat application that supports real 
                        <br>time bi-directional communication between clients and servers using express.js and socket.io and 
                        <br>deployed the app to the internet.
                        <br>
                        <br>Cheng Liang is enthusiastic about practical, challenging projects and tasks. Furthermore, he is 
                        <br>always excited to interact with different talented engineers and people from different backgrond. 
                        <br>He is a dilligent and smart person. The best proof of it is that he was once awared dean's list in 
                        <br>2015 by National Chiao Tung University, which ranked top 3 in CS in Taiwan. 
                        <br>
                        <br>Cheng Liang is also active in extracurricular activities. He was a member of cake club and they 
                        <br>delivered free snacks to local charity organizations in Hsinchu. In his free time, he likes to 
                        <br>go to gym to do different exercises and study magic tricks.
                        <br>
                        <br>He is a strong candidate for a software engineer position and can contribute a lot to the company 
                        <br>with his skills and experience.

                        <p>
                            This is a database management system that supports basic SQL operations including 
                            Selection, Projections, Joins and Aggregate operations.The system consists of 
                            five key modules. The first module is page file manager, which handles data 
                            reading and writing. Every piece of data in this system is stored in 
                            database pages. The second module is record based manager, which handles the 
                            structure of a page. The third module is index manager, which uses unclustered 
                            B+ balanced tree to create indexes for records. The forth module is relation manager, which extracts the 
                            information of the records that match a specific condition in a page. 
                            The fifth module is search engine. The engine is responsible for extracting 
                            information of records that match several conditions simultaneously.

                        <p>
                            Chat++ is a web chat application written in node js. I used express.js 
                            to build my node js web server. And I used Socket.io library to support 
                            real-time bi-directional communication between web clients and server. 
                            A user can join a specific chat room and send message and his/her current 
                            location to other users in that chatroom. The data stored in this app 
                            is non-persistent, which means that it is not available after fully 
                            closing the application. I used Jest testing framework to perform 
                            unit tests to ensure the correctness of my chat app.

                                This is a calendar desktop application written in Java and is the final team project of CS2103: 
                                Software Engineering (National University of Singapore). It supports agenda planning with 
                                functionalities including ranked by priority, recurring event and customized search. I implemented 
                                the user interface with JavaFX, which is a MVC UI framework.I was also responsible for creating unit 
                                tests for the application and continuous integration with Travis CI. I increased the test coverage form
                                70% to 90%.
